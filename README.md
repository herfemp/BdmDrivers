These drivers are not complete and littered with bugs. Just functional enough to recover my ECU's after I've f-ed for the millionth time while working on bootloaders. Hence the speed, which is my only concern. I _really_ hate the waiting part..

T5:
39sf020: 4,64 secs(Only 256K), tn28f010: 8,21, cat28f010: 8,18, am28f010: 8,62, at29c010: 4~ Secs.

Note on Atmel: I've only flashed these with Thingy 2.0 (unreleased) Expect it to be slower with the included test host

T7: 11,37, T8: 22,32, MCP: 14,1 - 37,2 Secs.

-:Dump:-

T5: 2.35 Secs, T7: 4,61, t8: 6,92

I know with 100% certainty these times can be improved if you copy and paste some code from T5Legion. I'm just lazy :)
