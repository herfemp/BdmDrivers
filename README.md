Take a look in main.c of driverhost for some, to put it mildly, spectacular benchmarks  :)


These drivers are not complete and littered with bugs. Just functional enough to recover my ECU's after I've f-ed for the millionth time while working on bootloaders. Hence the speed, which is my only concern. I really hate the waiting part :D
